# Biography

I am a second year student at Drexel University studying User Experience and Interaction Design. I have multiple interests and would like to apply them throughout my career. My First year of college I explored different majors and despite finding other ones interesting, I chose UXID. I enjoy organizing things and making them much more functional and accessible. It is  important to me to maximize my space while not making it seem cluttered.

I have had the opportunities to explore my UX and UI abilities by managing websites, designing websites, and designing smaller projects such as interactive flyers. I have also been able to put my skills towards more technical projects such as writing and formatting contracting estimates and emails.

Outside of UXID, I enjoy exploring the city, learning about modern cultures from around the world, playing video games, and (of course) spending time with my friends and family.
